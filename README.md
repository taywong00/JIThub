This is a minesweeper-esque game borrowed from the Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver called “Voltorb Flip”. There is a 5x5 board with tiles facing down. Under each tile is either a Topher (aka a mine) or a 1, 2 or 3. The objective is to gain points, and the player does that by flipping the 2 and 3 tiles (the points are multiplicative, so there is no point gained from flipping a 1). Flipping a Topher results in an immediate game over. The objective is to flip all the 2s and 3s on the board to advance to the next level, which has a higher difficulty. On one end of each array, the total number of points and Tophers are shown as hints.
