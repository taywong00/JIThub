This is a minesweeper-esque game borrowed from the Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver called “Voltorb Flip”. There is a 5x5 board with tiles facing down. Under each tile is either a Topher (aka a mine) or a 1, 2 or 3. The objective is to gain points, and the player does that by flipping the 2 and 3 tiles (the points are multiplicative, so there is no point gained from flipping a 1). Flipping a Topher results in an immediate game over. The objective is to flip all the 2s and 3s on the board to advance to the next level, which has a higher difficulty. On one end of each array, the total number of points and Tophers are shown as hints. 

Launch Instructions: 
1) Enter "java Woo.java" in the terminal, a grid will appear.

2) Select a tile by entering its labelled letter (ie. a,b,c,d,...)

3) A prompt will pop up asking you what you want to do with this tile

4) To take notes: type in your line of notes and hit Enter to exit note taking

5) Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the game is won/lost!
