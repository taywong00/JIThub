Period 4


To-Do List




1. Create two ArrayLists, (D: String; V: Integer) and populate them (D: “a, b, c, d…”; V: 1,3,3,0,1...) (note: 0 == a topher)
2. Create any instance variable needed and basic methods in D and V. (MakeTophers, SetVal, etc)
3. 4. Create the two additional row/column that display the current number of numbers and tophers in each row/column (--> aka create new ArrayLists)
5. 6. Design the user interface at the beginning of the game, including strings of greetings, rules, ascii arts, the complete grid of AL, player input requests, stats of current points & rounds/levels, etc)
7. 8. Write the Flip method in main, which allows the two corresponding values in the two AL to be switched with each other (--> print the switched value in place of the orig value to test its functionality)
9. Add the functionality that if the player flips a topher, <> happens
10. Add the note taking feature
11. Add the level up feature
12. More interactions with the player & ascii arts
